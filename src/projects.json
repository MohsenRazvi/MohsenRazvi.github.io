The front end of this app is implemented with React and React-Redux. Complex UI interactions including Drag and Drop. The price data processing in this app is implemented using concepts from Deep Learning, Monte-Carlo simulations and Modern Portfolio Theory.","link":""},
    {"id":2,"title":"AI Application of Statistical Characterisation of Excursions at Level Crossings in the Stock Market - MSc project","description":"Achieved designing and founding a new method of Monte Carlo simulation which leverages the underlying mechanisms of Monte Carlo simulations through level crossing methods in order to better predict contextual price ranges. This is combined with the use of AI to produce intelligently guided simulations for market prediction in terms of direction and volatility. Developed statistical-based trading strategy using confidence intervals and predicted volatility extracted from simulations","link":""},
    {"id":3,"title":"NLP Social Media Sentiment Analysis","description":"Led a university group project to produce an algorithm which uses twitter and Reddit APIâ€™s to scrape social media posts on US companies in order to conduct sentiment analysis using Machine Learning. The results of the program were used for speculating on the stock market.","link":""},
    {"id":4,"title":"Social Media Platform","description":"Developed a web application where users create image-based posts about their professional projects. Other users receive and can interact with these posts on their news feed. Each user can design their custom profile page gallery according to whichever projects they choose to display. Users require login and pages/interactions require a certain level of authentication. This controls what and how users may interact with others in the application","link":""},
    {"id":5,"title":"E-Commerce Site","description":"Developed an e-commerce store application where users login, view the catalog, select and put items into their basket and purchase the items. Application connected to Stripe API","link":""},
